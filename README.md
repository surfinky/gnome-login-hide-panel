# gnome-login-hide-panel

This is an extension to hide the top panel on Gnome's Login Manager (GDM) user login.

With a multi-user desktop system, you may not want average users getting their paws all over Quick Settings etc. in the top panel at login. My workstation is acting as a desktop, entertainment kiosk and network server (over WiFi) and the last thing I need is Jamesy disabling my WiFi connection at the login screen whenever I leave the keyboard on the couch while I go get a coffee.

Jamesy is a **sheepdog**. I know him, very well.

# Installation

To make this extension available to all users on the system, install in the /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions directory. Note that newly-installed machine-wide extensions are disabled by default.
